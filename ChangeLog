5.3 - Sun Dec  1 16:36:52 CET 2013

This release fixes several bugs and adds two new pie charts about the most use
top second level domains. It is also possible to do DNS lookup of Ip addresses
inside SquidAnalyzer, see UseClientDNSName new configuration directive. This can
slow down dramatically the squid-analyzer performances but you can adjust the
DNS lookup timeout to prevent waiting slow DNS server, See DNSLookupTimeout new
configuration directive.

	- Update and fix first and second top level domain name. Thanks to Luis
	  Armando Roca Fumero for the report.
	- Add new directive DNSLookupTimeout to change the default timeout for
	  DNS lookup. Add 0.0001 second timeout when SquidAnalyzer look for a DNS
	  name and can't find a name server. Thanks to alex for the patch.
	- Add pie chart of top second level domains. Thanks to Jeetendra Poojari
	  for the feature request.
	- Fix some HTML tag issues and table ordering on Top domain hits and Top
	  url hits. Thanks to Jeetendra Poojari for the report.
	- Update INSTALL file to remove GD::Graph requirements.
	- Change underscore used to replace space in user name by the special
	  string _SPC_ so that underscore will not be wrongly replaced on HTML
	  output.
	- Fix pt_BR translation with charset to utf-8 and a few words with
	  accentuation fix. Thanks to Joseh-Henrique for the fix.
	- Allow Ip addresses on user names to be replaced by their DNS name, this
	  feature is activated by a new directive: UseClientDNSName. Thanks to
	  Pfisztner Tamas for the patch.
	- Add missing description of --no-year-stat option to documentation and
	  squid-analyzer usage.

UPDATE: you must override all your installation, Perl scripts, configuration file,
CSS and Javascript files. Backward compatibility with data files is fully preserved.
Note that if you run a Perl version < 5.8 you may need the CPAN module Time::HiRes.

5.2 - Sun Sep  1 21:17:53 CET 2013

This is release fixes lot of minor bugs and adds support to CIDR notation in
network-alias and exclude files as well as some code rewriting and options to
improve speed. New feature to show the top N users that look at an url or a
domain. Adds a new configuration directive, TopUrlUser, to control the number
of users to show in reports.

	- Fix pod2man error with perl 5.18 about non-ascii character. Thanks to
	  David Walser for the report.
	- Skip some unwanted code execution when --no-year-stat is enabled.
	- Fix graphs on domain statistics reports.
	- Fix badly ordered check on squid log file to parse. Thanks to wordelle
	  for the report.
	- Fix issue where squid-analyzer use default configuration file even if
	  a custom one is specified with the -c option. Thanks to Thibaud Aubert
	  for the report.
	- Add --no-year-stat to disable year statistics, reports will start from
	  month level only. This allow to save time during reports generation.
	- Allow composed top level domain statistics in Top Domain report, like
	  co.uk. Thanks to Thibaut Aubert for the feature request.
	- Add support to CIDR notation in network-alias file. Thanks to Thibaud
	  Aubert for the feature request.
	- Fix issue in Domain report where domain of top url was not found in
	  the domain report even if the download was bigger than those reported.
	  Thanks to Aubert Thibaud for the report.
	- Fix bug in last/first hour of a day data storage that mixed collected
	  data over the two days and stored false first and last visit time.
	- Fix translation for user and count strings.
	- Add -b | --build_date command line option to limit rebuilt to a given
	  date, the format of its value can be yyyy-mm-dd, yyyy-mm or yyyy. This
	  should be used to prevent rebuilding html files from all data files.
	- New feature to show the top N users that look at an url or a domain.
	  Add a new configuration directive, TopUrlUser, to control the number
	  of users to show. Thanks to Mr-Ed for the feature resquest.

	  xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/n network. Thanks to the MangOuste for the patch.
	- Add WriteDelay configuration directive (default to 3600 - stores one
	  hour of statistics from log file) to be able to save resources on huge
	  log files. On small log file it is not a good idea to set a lower
	  value as SquidAnalyzer will spend his time to write and read from
	  disk. This is a first attempt to speedup statistic reports, especially	  with year and month, but do not expect lot of performances gain.
	- Add regex checker for alias file and improve speed for network and
	  alias replacement. Thanks to jcputter for the report.
	- Fix unwanted message display in quiet mode.

	  Thanks to ammdispose for the patch.

	  Kassem forn the patch.
	- Recode initial column sorted by default to fix pending sort issues.
	- Fix bug on ordering column with sorttable. Thanks to David Walser for
	 the report.
	- Fix support to regex with coma in user and network alias file. Regex
	  like "1stFloor 192.168.1.1\d{0,2}" in user-aliases and network-aliases	  was not permitted. Thanks to Steffen Junick for the report.
	- Fix issue with log file provided at command line (option -l) and non

UPGRADE: You must reinstall all. Backward compatibility is preserved on data
files, but the HTML reports have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer
you may want to run manually squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line
option to regenerate those files.  So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.1.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.1/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild
        
should be the normal procedure to upgrade. Change the path to the HTML output
dir if required.

	  report.

UPGRADE: You must reinstall all but backward compatibility is fully preserved.
Even if backward compatibility is preserved on data files, the HTML and graph
have changed, so after re-installing SquidAnalyzer you may want to run manually
squid-analyzer with the --rebuild command line option to regenerate those files.
So run the following commands:
        
        tar xzf SquidAnalyzer-5.0.tar.gz
        cd SquidAnalyzer-5.0/
        perl Makefile.PL HTMLDIR=/var/www/squidanalyzer
        make && make install
        /usr/local/bin/squid-analyzer --rebuild

dir if required.
